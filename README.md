# Machine-learning
notes:
Given the MAGIC gamma telescope dataset that can be obtained using this Link. This dataset
is generated to simulate registration of high energy gamma particles in a ground-based atmospheric
Cherenkov gamma telescope using the imaging technique. The dataset consists of two
classes; gammas (signal) and hadrons (background). There are 12332 gamma events and 6688
hadron events. You are required to use this dataset to apply different classification models
such as Decision Trees, N a¨ı ve Bayes Classifier, Random Forests and AdaBoost You are
also required to tune the parameters of these models, and compare the performance of
models with each other.
